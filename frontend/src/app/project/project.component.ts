Instead, they provide functionality (like HTTP requests) to the TypeScript logic of the component. They are injected via the constructor and do not require inclusion in imports: [].

   Dependency Injection of HttpClient
   Why not just do `private http = HttpClient`?

      - By using the constructor, Angular injects a ready-to-use instance of HttpClient automatically
      - Long story short : This is how Angular was designed to handle dependenciesâ€”via the constructor, which allows Angular to provide and manage instances of services like HttpClient.

    - 'ngOnInit' is just a reserved name for a function that has a special meaning to Angular (it recognizes it as a 'lifecycle hook')

      - When a component is created 'ngOnInit()'
      - When a component is destroyed 'ngOnDestroy()'
    - 'ngOnInit' doesn't actually do anything on its own. You choose what it does in a component class.
    - Whenever a component is created, Angular looks for a function called 'ngOnInit', and runs whatever is inside of it.

      .subscribe always listens to an observable object, which either will emit values (response) or an errors (error) and can take two types of paramters:
        - 1: A function. When given a function, .subscribe performs the function with the assumption that there was no error.
          That is, it will have no error catching. E.g. .subscribe((response) => {do stuff}). It always expects a response

        - 2: An object. When given an object, it will have reserved key names (next, error, complete). Each key will have its own function, where it has access to the emitted values/errors from the observable
          'Next' handles what happens upon a value being emmited from the observable
          'Error' handles what happens upon an error from the observable (an error is returned instead of a value)
          'Complete' handles what happens after the request is complete
          E.g. {next : (response) => {do stuff}, error : (response) => {do stuff}, complete : (response) => {do stuff}}
          All of these keys are optional. Technically, you could provide .subscribe with an empty object, {}. Although not functional, it still wouldn't cause an error

          What happens in any of these functions is up to us. There is no requirement to use the response object at all.
          Both of these wouldn't throw any error : 
          .subscribe({next : () => {console.log('hello')}})
          .subscribe(() => {console.log('hello)})

          If an error is emmited from the observable, then the observable terminates. And so subscribe() won't do anything.

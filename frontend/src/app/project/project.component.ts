    Imports in the imports array: These are Angular modules that provide directives, components, or pipes used in the HTML template (like ngIf, ngFor, ngModel, etc.). They need to be in the imports array because they affect the view layer directly.

Instead, they provide functionality (like HTTP requests) to the TypeScript logic of the component. They are injected via the constructor and do not require inclusion in imports: [].

   Dependency Injection of HttpClient
   Why not just do `private http = HttpClient`?
      - Because that would just reference the HttpClient class itself, not an instance of it
      - By using the constructor, Angular injects a ready-to-use instance of HttpClient automatically
      - Long story short : This is how Angular was designed to handle dependenciesâ€”via the constructor, which allows Angular to provide and manage instances of services like HttpClient.

    - 'ngOnInit' is just a reserved name for a function that has a special meaning to Angular (it recognizes it as a 'lifecycle hook')
    - (All hooks in Angular are 'lifecycle methods', methods that run at specific part of a component's life cycle) e.g.
      - When a component is created 'ngOnInit()'
      - When a component is destroyed 'ngOnDestroy()'
    - 'ngOnInit' doesn't actually do anything on its own. You choose what it does in a component class.
    - Whenever a component is created, Angular looks for a function called 'ngOnInit', and runs whatever is inside of it.
